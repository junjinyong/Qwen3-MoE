    NOTE: This function is only used when torch version is torch<2.5 - see `sdpa_mask_recent_torch` otherwise.

    Create a 4D boolean mask of shape `(batch_size, 1, query_length, kv_length)` where a value of True indicates that
    the element should take part in the attention computation, and False that it should not.
    If `allow_torch_fix=True` (the default), rows corresponding to query tokens that do not attend
    to any other tokens (due to padding) will be fully attended to instead, in order to avoid `nan` propagation (this does
    not change the final result).

        kv_length (`int`):
            The size that the key and value states will have during the attention computation.
        kv_offset (`int`, optional):
            An optional offset to indicate at which first position the key and values states will refer to.
